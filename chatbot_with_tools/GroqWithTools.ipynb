With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.\\n  This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-01-07\\nTitle: DOME: Recommendations for supervised machine learning validation in biology\\nAuthors: Ian Walsh, Dmytro Fishman, Dario Garcia-Gasulla, Tiina Titma, Gianluca Pollastri, The ELIXIR Machine Learning focus group, Jen Harrow, Fotis E. Psomopoulos, Silvio C. E. Tosatto\\nSummary: Modern biology frequently relies on machine learning to provide predictions and improve decision processes. There have been recent calls for more scrutiny on machine learning performance and possible limitations. Here we present a set of community-wide recommendations aiming to help establish standards of supervised machine learning validation in biology. Adopting a structured methods description for machine learning based on data, optimization, model, evaluation (DOME) will aim to help both reviewers and readers to better understand and assess the performance and limitations of a method or outcome. The recommendations are formulated as questions to anyone wishing to pursue implementation of a machine learning algorithm. Answers to these questions can be easily included in the supplementary material of published papers.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-12-20\\nTitle: Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Transformer Condition Monitoring -- Part I: Basic Concepts, Neural Networks, and Variants\\nAuthors: Jose I. Aizpurua\\nSummary: Power transformers are critical assets in power networks, whose reliability directly impacts grid resilience and stability. Traditional condition monitoring approaches, often rule-based or purely physics-based, struggle with uncertainty, limited data availability, and the complexity of modern operating conditions. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools to complement and extend these methods, enabling more accurate diagnostics, prognostics, and control. In this two-part series, we examine the role of Neural Networks (NNs) and their extensions in transformer condition monitoring and health management tasks. This first paper introduces the basic concepts of NNs, explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for condition monitoring using diverse data modalities, and discusses the integration of NN concepts within the Reinforcement Learning (RL) p'"

Based on Cline's 2011 novel Ready Player One, it stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. The film is set in 2045, where much of humanity uses the OASIS, a virtual reality simulation, to escape the real world. Teenage orphan Wade Watts finds clues to a contest that promises ownership of the OASIS to the winner, and he and his allies try to complete it before an evil corporation can do so.\n",

In July 2015, Spielberg signed on to direct and produce the film, with casting commencing in September 2015. Filming began in England in June 2016 and was completed in September that year. The visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain and Territory Studio, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor, Inc.. As with the novel, many popular culture references appear throughout the film, including those to the Back to the Future franchise, The Iron Giant, The Shining, King Kong, and the Godzilla franchise.\n",
